#Interactive C# Notebook
ICSharp is an C# language kernel for [Jupyter.](http://jupyter.org) It allows users
to use Jupyter's Notebook frontend, except where Jupyter executes python code, ICSharp
can execute C# code. It is based on Roslyn REPL engine of [scriptcs.](http://scriptcs.net/),
so all the goodies of scriptcs comes along with it.

This is on top of all of Jupyter's other frontend features like Markdown rendering,
HTML rendering, saving notebooks for later use and even the ability to view ICSharp
Notebooks in [Jupyter's NBViewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

###Disclaimer
The development of this language kernel for C# is at it's very early stages.
This is Alpha. Take with a large pinch of salt :)

###Feedback

    "F# is an open-source and cross-platform language which excels at succinct, correct and maintainable code. F# is used for [data scripting](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/low-risk-ways-to-use-fsharp-at-work-2/), [data science](http://fslab.org), [web programming](http://fsharp.org/guides/web/) and component development. It interoperates with a wide range of software libraries and tools and all .NET and C# libraries can be used directly from F#.  A key characteristic of F# is that you can use it from small-scale scripting and development to large-scale software delivery. \n",
    "\n",
    "F# is well suited for literate programming using Azure and Jupyter notebooks because declarations are ordered in a script-like way. This notebook assumes you are familiar with some programming already. However, the examples are kept simple, so if you are just learning F#, that's fine too! There are lots of excellent [F# learning resources](http://fsharp.org/learn.html) available online. The [F# Cheetsheet](https://dungpa.github.io/fsharp-cheatsheet/) is a quick guide. \n",
    "\n",
    "F# is supported by the [F# Software Foundation](http://fsharp.org) and a worldwide community of contributors. Microsoft and other companies develop professional tooling for F#. The [F# Language Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/) is a reference for the F# language, and the [F# Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/) covers general topics.  [F# on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/using-fsharp-on-azure/) is a technical guide for using F# in conjunction with a range of Azure services.\n",
